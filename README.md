# CS50

Problem Sets from CS50x, Harvard University's free online introduction to Computer Science. 

## About 

During the Spring of 2021 I was becoming increasingly focused on developing a strong fundamental understanding of Computer Science. I began my journey to learn CS through the internet with MIT's Introduction to Computer Science with Python (6.001). While it was a great class, I thought there were still many fundamental skills that I was lacking so I decided to search for another introductory cs class. In May 2021, I found CS50x and immediately felt encapsulated by David Malan's teaching style. 

I feel incredibly grateful to the CS50 staff for providing such an amazing education for free on the internet. Their work inspired me to create my own open source R and Python API packages for the Blackbaud Sky API - A REST API for a popular Student Information System that my employer (Tampa Prep) was using at the time.
